# Example scoring rules for the FireScanner full application.

# The `weights` section would normally specify the relative importance
# of individual factors used to compute the composite score.  These
# values are placeholders for demonstration only.
weights:
  volatility: 0.4
  momentum: 0.3
  fundamentals: 0.3

# The `thresholds` section defines boundaries for categories such as
# high or low scores.  Thresholds can be used to derive badges or
# freshness indicators.  These are examples and may be modified.
thresholds:
  high: 90.0
  medium: 75.0
  low: 50.0

# The `badges` section lists optional badges that can be assigned to
# items based on criteria.  Production logic can refer to this
# configuration when deriving badges.  In this demo the criteria are
# implemented directly in the engine.
badges:
  elite:
    criteria: "score > 90"
  high:
    criteria: "score > 75"
